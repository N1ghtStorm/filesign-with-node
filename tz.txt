It's necessary to implement pallet basic structure

files storage
extrinsics
file structure:

{
  id: <ID>,
  owner: <Address>,
  versions: [{
    tag: <String>,
    hash: <Hash>,
    signs: [{
      address: <Address>,
      signed: <Boolean>,
      sign_hash: <Hash>
    }]
  }],
  auditors: [{
    address: <Address>
  }]
}
extrinsics:

#-> done:
create file
assign auditor to file
delete auditor for file
sign last version of file (with address checking)

#-> in progress:
get info by tag

#-> todo:
check file signature status (does last version of file have all signatures)
explore ordered list of tags
