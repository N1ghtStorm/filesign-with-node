It's necessary to implement pallet basic structure

files storage
extrinsics
file structure:

{
  id: <ID>,
  owner: <Address>,
  versions: [{
    tag: <String>,
    hash: <Hash>,
    signs: [{
      address: <Address>,
      signed: <Boolean>,
      sign_hash: <Hash>
    }]
  }],
  auditors: [{
    address: <Address>
  }]
}
extrinsics:

create file
assign auditor to file
delete auditor for file
check file signature status (does last version of file have all signatures)
explore ordered list of tags
get info by tag
sign last version of file (with address checking)
